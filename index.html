          <p>She's a beaut and we knew at first sight we wanted her. The man who built it out did a much better job than we could have fathomed so it was a no-brainer that it was awesome. We gave her a test-sleep and that was it... we were changing up our lives to try out this crazy idea.</p>
          <p>In case you were wondering, she's dark blue and has a bear beer bottle opener as the hood ornament.</p>

        <h1>WHY, YOU MAY ASK?</h1>
        <div class="main__para">
          <p>Welp, that's an awesome question. Other than the fact that it's super popular on instagram and it looks cool there is something special about being able to wake up wherever you want, comfortably, and live in a simpler way. You have what you can carry and that's all. It's a longer-term deal than backpacking but it's a similar idea.</p>
          <p>But we didn't go on epic adventures and climb all the towers in Utah. Instead, we worked our normal jobs in Boulder, CO and tried out a lifestyle that a handful were doing. We made a lot of friends at the climbing gym.</p>

      <section class="the-how__main">
        <h1>BUT HOW? SO MANY QUESTIONS..</h1>
        <div class="main__para">
          <p>I'm keeping it short here. The fact is, that there isn't a lot of space to keep everything. I gave a lot of belongings away (this wasn't my first rodeo) and stored my winter gear at a trusted location.</p>
          <p>I basically decided on the things that I wanted in my life, and I went with it. For my partner and I, we needed two of all eating utensils, adventure gear, and a few books. The basic rule was more adventures and less things. But we definitely had to remind each other more than once "hey, we don't have space for that".</p>
          <p>Logistics you figure out REAL quick. Where do we clean our dirty dishes? How do we clean ourselves? Relax, and figure it out!</p>
          <p>It would have been sweet to hit the open road and take epic photos of our lives- but that really wasn't our style. We wanted to live simply, live closer to the outdoors, and be together.</p>

      <section class="the-where__main">
        <h1>YOU SLEEP... IN THERE?</h1>
        <div class="main__para">
          <p>This was a toughy- especially living in an area that sleeping in your vehicle was illegal. National Forests are preferred and dirt roads are the best. But sometimes that isn't always possible, especially if you gotta pay the bills.</p>
          <p>So we found an awesome solution! We did what we wanted and when we needed a home base we went to a gym that had showers, exercise equipment, wifi, and a dance studio. It had everything that we needed outside of our tiny home.</p>

        <h1>Someone's Truth</h1>
        <div class="main__para">
          <p>It was tough at times, duh. And I would do it all over again. It was amazing to live in the elements once again and feel closer to nature. It was also amazing to remember that I don't need a lot to be happy and that I can make my dreams a reality. Nothing is perfect yet pursuing the love of life is the most epic journey and the greatest reward. Yehaw!</p>
